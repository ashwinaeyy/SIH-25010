## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The solution focuses on introducing a Smart Agricultural Support System that integrates modern technology with traditional farming. It includes soil health monitoring, water-efficient irrigation, AI-based pest/disease detection, and farmer advisory services through a mobile application in local languages. This will help farmers make informed decisions, reduce crop losses, and increase productivity sustainably.

The uniqueness lies in combining IoT-enabled devices, AI-driven analytics, and community-level support hubs, making technology accessible and affordable for rural farmers.

Technical Approach

Technologies to be used:

IoT sensors for soil moisture, pH, and nutrient monitoring.

AI/ML models for crop disease and pest prediction.

Android mobile app for farmer advisory (local language support).

Cloud computing for data storage and real-time insights.

Solar-powered smart irrigation systems.

Methodology and Process:

Pilot Phase: Deploy sensors and mobile advisory system in selected farms.

Integration: Link sensor data with AI models to provide crop-specific recommendations.

Farmer Outreach: Train farmers through rural tech hubs and demonstration farms.

Scaling: Expand across villages with government and cooperative partnerships.

Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility: Affordable IoT devices and increasing rural internet penetration make the solution practical. Partnerships with agricultural universities and government schemes will support deployment.

Challenges & Risks:

Farmers’ reluctance to adopt new technology.

Initial cost of devices and maintenance.

Training needs for rural populations.

Strategies:

Provide government subsidies and financial incentives.

Conduct awareness programs and field demonstrations.

Build farmer cooperatives to share costs and benefits.

Impact and Benefits

Target Audience: Farmers, agricultural cooperatives, agri-entrepreneurs, and rural youth.

Social Impact: Farmer empowerment, reduced rural distress, improved food security.

Economic Benefits: Increased yields, reduced input costs, better access to markets.

Environmental Benefits: Reduced chemical use, improved water management, sustainable farming practices.
